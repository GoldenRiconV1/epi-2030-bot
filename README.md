# Epitech 2030 

A small fun project where anyone from the 2030 Epitech Lyon promo can
contribute by adding features.\
This bot is built with the [Sapphire
Framework](https://github.com/sapphiredev/framework) and written in
TypeScript.

## How to use it

### Prerequisites

``` sh
npm install
```

### Development

You can run this bot with `tsc-watch` to watch files and automatically
restart the bot when changes are detected.

``` sh
npm run watch:start
```

### Production

You can also run the bot with `npm run dev`.\
This will first build your code and then execute
`node ./dist/index.js`.\
Note: this is not the recommended way to run a bot in production.
